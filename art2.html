<h1><b>How the NBA's Non-Bubble teams Can Improve in 2021</b></h1>
<h2>by Broderick O'Linn</h2>

<h3><b>Golden State Warriors - </b></h3>

<p> This team has, by far, the most options of any of the teams in this list. Regardless of what this team does in the offseason, they will more than likely be back in the playoffs in 2021. Steph, Klay, and Draymond will all be healthy next year and that alone should be enough to push them into the playoff picture. I would hate to be a team in the West because there are a good 10 or 11 teams that have a legitimate chance of making the postseason if they are all able to maintain their health. If no one blows it up this might be the most competitive playoff race next year. With this all being said, the Warriors will be one of those teams that will make it in next year. I know I’m calling this a year in advance, but this team has so many options to make this offseason and I’m not sure they can really mess any of them up. The Warriors are guaranteed a top-5 pick in this draft and that’s probably the worst move they could make this offseason. If I’m saying having a top-5 pick in the draft is the worst possible outcome for the offseason, then your team is in a really damn good position. They could draft a back court player and try to roll out a new death lineup with Wiggins, Green, Klay, and Steph. Looking at the top, LaMelo and Edwards are both enticing, but neither would immediately fit the Warriors system. I watched Edwards in person and his decision making is still lacking along with his streaky shooting. If he’s willing to play a Harrison Barnes type role in this offense, I could see him MAYBE fitting, but I still think there are better options. Melo would be a better fit, but I’m not sure how well he can play off ball and if he can space the floor effectively. I haven’t seen Ball play enough with another primary ball handler to tell if he could do it. He also didn’t shoot the ball well from deep when he played for Illawarra. 25% isn’t screaming death lineup to me, but there’s no denying the potential with him. If he can develop into an off ball player, he can be lethal in this offense. He has great size and is an amazing passer for his age so he can hit Steph and Klay for plenty of open shots if Draymond needs a break from being a playmaker. Also, if that 3 PT% could hover around 34-36, I would jump on the guy and deal with all the LaVar Ball talk. I know there are people screaming at the Warriors to draft one of the Top Centers, but that has never really been their play style. The past 7 years the Warriors have thrived on playing small and spreading the floor instead of having a dominant center down low. I guess they could draft one so they have a counter to Jokic or Embiid, but why just draft someone to answer a problem that they dealt with in the past by not even playing a Center. Out of all the options, LaMelo makes the most sense, but the Warriors are in a win now mentality and may not have the patience to implement Ball. If raving about the potential of Ball in this lineup is the lesser of the options, I’d feel pretty good. The next two options are both trades and are both my advised moves. First, they could go all in on an All-Star and try to make another run at the Championship. Steph isn’t particularly young so the window may not be open for very long on adding to the already long resume. Trading the top pick could be the best thing to do so they can try to capitalize on the little time they have. In addition, Steph has dealt with his fair share of injuries so having another All-Star to defer to could be the best thing for this team. The only negative to all of this are the uncertainties surrounding this draft. To start, this is a weak class compared to recent memory and there won’t be pre draft workouts to properly scout these players. Furthermore, there are so many question marks surrounding the top players that teams may stray away from trading. Luckily, there are some teams that may just try to rebuild early and take a risk. For all of these scenarios I will assume that the Warriors end with the top pick because they had the worst record. The first trade I have has to have a lot happen and it’s still a wild one. Here is what it looks like:</p>

<p><b>Warriors receive:</b> Khris Middleton <br> <b>Bucks receive:</b> Bradley Beal <br> <b>Wizards receive:</b> 1st round Pick.</p>

<p>For this scenario, here would also be various players and picks thrown in here to make the money work I just haven’t totally figured that part out.
I know this is wild, but it may make sense when I give my full explanation. If the Bucks don’t win it all this year, they need to make changes in order to win. Beal would give them another playmaker outside of Giannis and gives them a better opportunity to win, in my opinion. Giannis will definitely leave if they don’t win a championship and this could address one of their only problems. Beal can shoot the ball extremely well and doesn’t rely on others to get a bucket. Beal will inevitably get traded and what’s better than dumping his salary and getting a good return. The Wizards will receive the #1 (assuming the Warriors get it) pick to pair with the pick they already have. The Warriors also get the perfect player to fit in their system. I see this as a win for all teams. This may look good on paper, but we all know this will 99.99% not happen.</p>

<p>Here’s a more realistic trade:</p>

<p><b>Warriors Receive:</b> Aaron Gordon <br> <b>Magic Receive:</b> 1st Pick</p>

<p>This is a much more realistic trade that will benefit both teams. Magic are in the weird influx of being a Playoff team, but not a contender. They could take the pick and take a risk on a player or use it as more trade capital to go after another star. In return, the Warriors receive an athletic beast that can guard nearly every position. It adds a lot of versatility to the death lineup and he can be seen as a much younger Andre Iguodala. A death lineup of Steph, Klay, Dray, Gordon, and Wiggins just seems like an AAU team or something you’d see at Rucker Park. I see this as the most possible and likely trade to occur, but I’ll keep my hopes alive for the Middleton and Beal deal.</p>

<h3><b>Cleveland Cavaliers - </b></h3>

<p>Oh my beloved Cleveland Cavaliers. What a shit show we have been lately. There are many question marks with my team and not a whole lot of answers and, unlike the Warriors, we don’t have too many options. I hate when teams switch GMs and Coaches too often because there isn’t a cohesive vision. We probably wouldn’t have drafted the way we have the past several years if we weren't switching coaches all the time. To start, I don’t like the Garland and Sexton back court. It’s two ball dominant players that aren’t quite sure how to play with each other. Sexton can score the ball very well, but hasn’t learned how to be an efficient playmaker yet. He would be a great sixth man because of his instant offense ability if he would accept that role. If I was drafting a few years ago, I am easily snagging Michael Porter Jr. and trying to build for the long term. He inevitably would sit out with injuries and we would have a worse record. The next draft, we would have a better pick and possibly have Zion or Ja Morant. Unfortunately, I can’t change the past and I’ll work around the log jam we have. Going by record, we have the second pick and there are two options I have for this scenario. The first, we draft with the team we have. If this is the case, I’d probably select Edwards/Ball, whichever isn’t taken 1. If neither is taken 1, I’ll say Edwards. With this team trading for Drummond and refraining from dealing Love, I’ll assume that this is the front court the Cavs want to roll with. Sexton will need to move to the bench in order for this to work or we’d deal him somewhere else. I won’t do any Sexton trade scenarios because I do feel it’s in the Cavs best interest to keep him. A lineup of Garland, Edwards, KPJ, Love, and Drummond actually doesn’t sound bad. Edwards will have some frustrating points because of how poor his decision making can be. Sometimes he messes with the entire flow of the offense because he takes poor shots early in the shot clock. However, there’s no denying the offensive potential that Edwards can provide for this team. With that being said, there are a lot of kinks to workout with this lineup, but a worse lineup went .500 once Drummond was inserted. A weak mid-tier Eastern Conference could allow a path for this team to somehow sneak in. However, too many uncertainties are between now and next year for me to give a prediction for this team. If this team severely underperforms, Love will be traded and possibly Drummond. I would hate to see both of these guys walk for nothing when we could get some draft capital for giving them to contenders. Koby Altman has already made some smart trades in his short career. He takes on bad contracts while adding on picks for the future. This is what bad teams need to do to rebuild and if they hit on the picks they should be back in the playoff mix eventually. <br>
The next scenario is keeping the pick, but trading Love. Being completely honest, I think Love is gone unless the Cavs magically become a playoff team. So, in this package, Cleveland trades Love and drafts Obi Toppin. Obi Toppin is one of the players I absolutely love in this draft. He has by far the highest ceiling of any of the players entering and I believe he is the safest player to pick. His game reminds me a lot of Amar’e Stoudemire. He has insane athleticism and can read the floor well. He can be a great pick n’ roll player for Garland because of his ability to set good screens and cut to the basket and be a threat to stretch the floor and knock down threes. He shot 39% from deep at Dayton and that’s very impressive for someone his size. I would like to see him refine his post game a little more, but that is my only true complaint about his offensive game. Defensively, he’ll need to work on his quickness and reading the floor. This usually takes some time for big men so expect him to struggle a little on defense his first few years. <br>
As far as Kevin Love goes, there are not too many options for him so I’ll go with  the most likely destination for the stretch 4. There are three teams I can see him landing: Phoenix Suns, Sacramento Kings, and Portland Trail Blazers. I think the only realistic trade here is the Blazers. The best player that could be received is probably CJ McCollum and my optimistic ass will definitely assume the Cavs can snag him.</p>

<p><b>Trail Blazers Receives:</b> Kevin Love <br> <b>Cleveland Receives:</b> CJ McCollum, Nassir Little </p>

<p>I thought maybe to throw some picks in here, but I think this pretty much seems fair. McCollum and Love are both players that aren’t coveted by many teams so it’s best if they are just traded for each other. Both of these players go back to their hometowns so they will be welcomed by the fan base almost immediately. Love would give the Blazers the front court scoring that Lillard has wanted since Aldridge left. McCollum gets the opportunity to be a #1 option and develop into an All-NBA player. I think his and Garland’s games would mesh together well and could be a good tandem. Sexton may need to be traded in this situation with all the backcourt players. I only say to keep him with Edwards because weren’t not entirely sure how Edwards will be and he won’t be the #1 option. With McCollum here I think he’s surefire the first option. Nassir helps even out the contracts and is also a young player to throw in. Both of these teams benefit given the terrible circumstances they are in. Neither have much cap space and have players that the league aren’t too keen on trading for. In addition, both have missed their window to maximize the value of trade possibilities. Love could’ve gone for more a year ago and the Blazers could’ve gotten Love for maybe Whiteside and a future first. However, both teams hesitated and suffered for it. <br> Overall, this is a bad situation for the Cavs. If they can get the McCollum trade done, then they will be in a good situation given their shitty management. I would like to believe a lineup of Garland, McCollum, KPJ, Toppin, Drummond would be enough to make the playoffs in the East. </p>

<h3><b>Minnesota Timberwolves - </b></h3>

<p>There’s a lot to like here and a lot to hate. Their starting lineup looks fairly decent with Russell, Beasley, Okogie, Hernangomez, and KAT. Outside of that, it’s disgusting. The Wolves are in serious need of some help off the bench. They have Culver who will be around for the next three years, but I can’t find too big of a reason to keep some of the others. The even worse thing is they have almost no cap to help out. They have so much money tied around Russell and KAT already and James Johnson is also getting paid a baffling $16M to come off the bench. Beasley and Hernagomez are both RFA and will almost certainly be brought back. That leaves an opportunity for the MLE’s and that’s about it. Generally, veterans will sign MLE’s for contending teams and this Wolves team will struggle to make the playoffs next year. The Wolves might be able to find someone to take Johnson’s contract, but that will mean handing over some compensation in the form of draft picks. There are three teams I see as possible trade destinations for Johnson: The Pistons, the Knicks, and the Hornets. None of these teams will be contending soon and all either rebuilding or approaching it. This is how I see the trades playing out:</p>

<p><b>Pistons Receive:</b> James Johnson, Rights to Nets 2020 first round pick <br><b>Wolves Receive:</b> Bruce Brown <br> or </p>

<p><b>Hornets Receive:</b> James Johnson, Rights to Nets 2020 first round pick <br><b>Wolves Receive:</b> Caleb Martin <br> or </p>

<p><b>Knicks Receive:</b> James Johnson, 2021 First Round Pick (Lottery Protected) <br><b>Wolves Receive:</b> Julius Randle</p>

<p>More players could be added but I thought keeping it a simple trade would be best for right now. It sucks giving up the other first round pick this year, but it’s far more important to get players that can compete now if they are serious about making the jump. $16M off the books can be great for them and gives them options with Beasley and Hernangomez. Last thing this team should do is overpay role players that will clog up the salary cap for the future. Beasley in my mind is a must keep, but Hernangomez can be expendable if he signs a large contract. The Knicks trade is a win-win because Wolves add depth and someone to put next to KAT (also UK alum) and the Knicks knock off some salary for the 2021 free agent class. <br> The beacon of hope for the Wolves through all of this is that they are guaranteed a top- 7 draft pick that could either help with depth or their PF position. I see Isaac Okoro, Deni Avdija, and Obi Toppin as possible players that could have an immediate role with this team. Okoro is my favorite because he has the ability to be effective on the floor without the ball in his hands. He plays good defense on understands offensive sets well. He does struggle to create his own shot, but that should be easier to manage now since he’s playing with Russell and KAT. There’s not a whole lot more to mention for this team other than this. They made most of their significant moves at the trade deadline so their offseason should be relatively quiet compared to the rest of this list.</p>

<h3><b>Atlanta Hawks - </b></h3>

<p>Next to the Golden State Warriors, the Hawks are in a great position this offseason because of the vast opportunities they have. The only loss I see for them is if they overpay someone that is not a star player. The Hawks will have a top-8 guaranteed pick along with a lot of cap room. They have a lot of young guys on this team and not much veteran leadership. Trae has already gotten frustrated with this team and I think it’s better if they package some of this young talent and try to get a star to match Trae in the backcourt. The player I want to pair with Trae Young is none other than Zach Lavine. Lavine would fit the culture of this young Hawks team so well and he’s also an explosive athlete. He’s basically begging to be traded from the Bulls with their dumbass of a head coach trying to push Lavine away. A Young-Lavine tandem would be amazing and Lavine could possibly make up for Trae’s lack of defensive ability. The Hawks have plenty of money and this is how I have the trade going:</p>

<p><b>Hawks Receive:</b> Zach Lavine, Chandler Hutchinson <br> <b>Bulls Receive:</b> Dewayne Dedmon, Cam Reddish or Deandre Hunter, Kevin Huerter, Top 5 Protected 2021 First Round Pick(s)</p>

<p>If I were the Hawks, I would hate to see two of Reddish, Hunter, and Huerter go, but getting Lavine more than makes up for it. This Hawks team would be one of the most athletic and dynamic teams in the league. If they can use the rest of that salary cap to get some veterans around these guys, you’re looking at a solid playoff team. The Bulls have a rough situation going. They have a lot of players signed to a large amount of money that aren’t particularly good for their value. This can give them some young players, a good draft pick, and some money off of their books a few years earlier than expected. I would try to suggest who to sign for the Hawks, but I’m not sure who will be retained by teams entering the offseason so I’ll leave that as a blank space for now. Just know they have some money and will need to spend some of it to surround Trae with good defenders and veteran leadership. <br> Another positive for the Hawks is their draft pick. They are kind of in a position where they need to see who gets drafted ahead of them to really determine who to get. With or without the Lavine trade, Trae needs another guard that can either defend or run the offense when he’s on the bench. The Hawks have by far the worst offense in the league when Trae is off the floor. Yes, their defense is terrible with Trae on the floor, but looking at the net totals with him on/off it’s clear they are in need of another playmaker. At their current draft position, I would say Killian Hayes might be a good selection for them. He’s someone you can give minutes at Point Guard when Trae’s off the floor or plug into the 2 or 3 when Trae’s on the court. His mix of defense and play making would be a good fit for the Hawks. <br>One thing that is also getting tossed around recently is trading John Collins and then drafting a forward. If they feel that Collins won’t be a good defender and don’t want to pay him the money he wants, then they can trade him and get some valuable pieces along the way while also replacing him with a forward from this year's draft class. I think it’s best for the Hawks to keep him, but I’ll throw some options out there to play devil's advocate. </p>

<p><b>Hawks Receive:</b> Jonathan Isaac, Rights to swap 2022 1st round draft pick <br> <b>Magic Receive:</b> John Collins <br> or </p>

<p><b>Hawks Receive:</b> Kyle Kuzma, Danny Green <br> <b>Lakers Receive:</b> John Collins <br> or </p>

<p><b>Hawks Receive:</b> 2020 1st round pick <br> <b>Warriors Receive:</b> John Collins </p>

<p><b>Some potential lineups for the Hawks:</b></p>
<div class = "w3-content" style = "max-width:50%">
	<table class="w3-table w3-centered">
	<tr><td>PG: Trae Young</td><td>Trae Young</td></tr>
	<tr><td>SG: Zach Lavine</td><td>Zach Lavine</td></tr>
	<tr><td>SF: Cam Reddish</td><td>Jonathan Isaac</td></tr>
	<tr><td>PF: John Collins</td><td>*Draft Pick</td></tr>
	<tr><td>C: Clint Capela</td><td>Clint Capela</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>

<p>There’s too many to go through all of them, but these two seem like best case scenarios. Surrounding Trae with shooters or defenders seems like the superior options. The draft pick could either be Killian Hayes or Obi Toppin/Deni Avdija. Killian would slide Lavine and Isaac up a position which could produce a deadly lineup for the Hawks.</p>

<h3><b>Detroit Pistons - </b></h3>

<p>The Pistons failed with the Blake Griffin experiment. He got them into the playoffs once only to be swept by the Bucks. This isn’t a knock on Blake at all because I think he’s a great player, but just not a #1 option. Now, they have a lot of money committed to him long term with now true plan for the future. To make matters worse, they then traded Andre Drummond for basically a toaster and a printer. How do you get almost no return value from the league leader in rebounds?? The only benefit to this trade is that they got some money off their books, but it seems like he was going to be gone after this season either way so why trade him for such little value? I could go on with the questionable moves of this team, but that would take too long. To start this rebuild, trade Blake Griffin. He will help this team make the playoffs, not win a championship. If the Pistons are fine with mediocrity, by all means, keep him on this team and pay him his $36 million. I don’t see how you build a championship team with Blake Griffin as the focal point. My go to team for a trade would be Portland. This is how I see a Griffin-Portland trade going:</p>

<p><b>Portand Trail Blazers Receive:</b> Blake Griffin <br><b>Detroit Pistons Receive:</b> CJ McCollum, Zach Collins, 2020 First Round Pick (Top 3 Protected), 2022 First Round Pick (Top 5 Protected)</p>

<p>Taking on the McCollum contract for the future is rough and I don’t want to come off as hypocritical about players with bad contracts, but the addition of Zach Collins and the first round picks make this deal worth it. Those first round picks, if they draft well, could become building blocks for the team. The 2020 pick from Portland is too difficult to place because they are still in the bubble playing. I predict the Grizzlies coming out of the West so it should be in the Lottery which would make the Pistons have two Lottery picks in this year's draft. Two lottery picks and some young players isn’t too shabby for starting a rebuild. This deal also benefits the Blazers because it forces them to buy into the win now approach and gives them a solid #2 option and finally some frontcourt scoring. <br> The next trade I would make would be dealing Derrick Rose to LA. Here’s how I have the trade going:</p>

<p><b>Los Angeles Receives:</b> Derrick Rose <br><b>Detroit Pistons Receive:</b> Kyle Kuzma, Alex Caruso</p>

<p>Laker fans will hate to see Carushow go, but I wouldn’t be mad if you’re getting Derrick Rose in return. This is a real win-win here. The Lakers receive a playmaker and backcourt scoring off the bench while the Pistons get some young players that have shown flashes. I think this will be a much better situation for Kuz because he won’t be unsure of where he places on the team. Coming into Detroit he knows he’ll be one of the first couple options and knows he has to go out there and score the ball. <br> To conclude, the Pistons need to resign their two key players: Luke Kennard and Christian Wood. These two have shown that they will be great player for the Pistons and people who they will build around. Then, with their draft pick, select the most talented player available. They don’t have players that are 100% irreplaceable so they don’t have to avoid drafting a certain position. Kennard can man either the 2 or 3 and Wood is a 4 that can stretch to the 5. Pistons could go with Ball, Edwards, or Wiseman here and I wouldn’t have any complaints. If this is all done correctly, they can free up cap space, get younger all across the board, and hoard some good draft picks.</p>

<h3><b>New York Knicks - </b></h3>

<p>My lord some of these teams on here have no idea what they are doing and the New York Knicks are the best example of it. They’ve been trying to rebuild ever since Melo left and they have failed miserably at doing it. Every year they try to free space for their “BIG free agent pitch” and I think that’s the only plan the Knicks have had in the past 10 years. The thing is, they have failed time and time again at getting any of the top players to sign with them. They have to have at least something going for them if they want one of the top free agents to head there. Believe it or not, they actually did when they hit on the Porzingis pick and then they, in trademark New York Knicks fashion, trade him away for a calculator and some spare parts. Like c’mon New York some people actually root for you. The big part of that trade was DSJ and you have him stashed behind 3 or 4 guards. That’s not a knock on the coach for not playing him, it’s a knock on the GM for trading for a guy that’s not fit for today’s NBA. The age of just being a big city and nice location doesn’t cut it anymore. I guess when they don’t sign the best players available they just sign as many PF’s as possible and overpay all of them. All jokes aside, this team doesn’t have a great selling point. Their pitch right now revolves around Allonzo Trier, RJ Barrett, Frank Nitlinka and Mitchell Robinson. They’re going to need to add some more pieces or make some trades if they’re going to keep the same approach that hasn’t worked for them in recent memory. Now don’t get me wrong, those four players will be solid pieces moving forward, but that’s not convincing Giannis to sign with you. With the trade capital they currently have I don’t think it will be possible for them to trade for a star player and hope someone signs with them. What I would recommend is for the Knicks to take on bad contracts from teams looking to make moves so they can acquire as many draft picks as possible. They already have the Clippers pick this year and a right to swap next year. In addition, they have the Mavs’ next year. With the pick this year, they are hoping that LaMelo Ball falls to them so they can build around this kid. Enough drama revolves around the Knicks so adding LaVar Ball won’t do much more. After this, it’s just about getting picks and prepping for 2021. Here’s a list of bad contracts that they can try to take a hold of: James Johnson, Gorgui Dieng, Gordon Hayward, Nicolas Batum, and Otto Porter. Due to time and length, I’ll assume they are able to at least get a 1st round pick if one or more of these trades are completed. If they can package some picks together and maybe a few young guys, they can get a star player and be somewhat of a convincing free agent destination. <br>If the Knicks were smart, in which I’m convinced they are not, this wouldn't be a big free agency for them. With the amount of cap space they have it will be tempting to get some of the free agents available this offseason, but they cannot sign any big ones unless they want to run the risk of ruining their long term plans. 2021 is a massive free agent class with a whole lot of talent so my biggest recommendation is opening up as much cap for that class. Even if they strike out on the top few, they will probably hit on at least one if they can put together a somewhat convincing pitch. If they can receive some more picks, they either have a great young core or enough value to go and get a star. </p>

<h3><b>Chicago Bulls - </b></h3>

<p>Now let’s talk about another shit show. Looking at the contracts and the state of the team, this is not a good situation to be in. First, fire Jim Boylen. The players flat out don’t like him and they won’t want to stick around if he is still the coach. Next, their salary cap/contracts are horrendous. A little under a third of their salary cap is committed to three players (Satoransky, Young, and Felicio) that probably won’t be on a championship team in their careers unless they don’t play a significant role on their teams. In addition to those players, Otto Porter takes up nearly $30 million by himself. There are some good pieces here, but many changes need to be made. Coby White and Wendell Carter are great players to build around. From what we’ve seen from these two, they’ll develop into some solid players. I would throw Zach Lavine in this conversation, but he seems to really dislike the coach and his contract is favorable for a trade to a contender or up and rising team. <br>The Hawks trade from earlier would be beneficial for both teams so I would recommend it for the Bulls as well. It allows them to stockpile on young players and picks for the future and gives them some return for the inevitable departure of Zach Lavine. I would really try to get Cam Reddish and Huerter because I believe they compliment Coby White the best. Coby is a slasher that will need the floor to be space to utilize his skill set the best. In addition to these players, this move could also open up some cap in the future to sign some veterans or a big name player. This Bulls team would then have a fairly young core that would just need to figure things out before competing against better teams. <br>Lauri Markanen is still a big question mark after his rookie season. He started his career out very well, but injuries and some regression this year has him as someone I’m not sure how to place on this Bulls team. I still have faith that he could turn things around so not much work needs to be done in the frontcourt. The combo of Markanen and Wendell is a good mix of youth and skill. To add to that, Coby White is a great scoring point guard and has all the tools to be a top player in the league. He can score at all three levels already which is pretty rare to see. I think giving him the keys to this team gives them the best future. Once the game slows down for him, he’ll develop into a better passer so finding another shooter in this draft would be mutually beneficial. Whether it’s still Lavine, or a pair of Huerter and Hunter, Coby needs to be surrounded by weapons to utilize his skill set. If a Lavine trade does happen, I’d like to see the Bulls draft Killian Hayes if they pick ahead of the Hawks. After the draft, there’s not much the Bulls can do. Their cap is mostly taken up with horrible contracts so they’re stuck until after the 2021 season. During the 2021-2022 season rolls around, they’ll have plenty of cap to sign a top player in the league and with the plethora of talent they have, I don’t see why they should struggle.</p>

<h3><b>Charlotte Hornets - </b></h3>

<p>The Hornets are in a very strange situation. They’ve got money committed to people who shouldn’t be in their long term plans and they more than likely won’t have a top pick in a relatively weak draft class. The Terry Rozier contract is starting to look worse and worse by the minute and they still have money going to Nicolas Batum and Cody Zeller next year. Some of their building blocks are good, but not anything that will draw in free agents. Devonte Graham, even though he can be inefficient, has become a solid player for this team. PJ Washington has surprised in his rookie season and can help them win moving forward. Miles Bridges has shown his great potential and is someone that they should keep around as long as they don’t have to commit too much money to him. Other than these players, I don’t really see anything to really savor over. Malik Monk has been very streaky throughout his brief career. I’ve seen flashes of a great scorer and I’ve also seen mediocre play through long stretches. Maybe it’s just his fit in the offense that’s not working for him and he could use a change of scenery. However, the Hornets aren’t in win now mode so they can try to shift him around to see what works best for him. Their bench does not look good and is in serious need of depth. Top to bottom this team is in dire need of scoring. No one on their team averages more than 20 ppg and as a team they are dead last in total offense. If they somehow get the top pick they need to invest in Anthony Edwards. He’s someone who can create his own offense and maybe inject some life into this team. If he doesn’t fall to them, the Hornets should consider drafting a real Center. Cody Zeller is not cutting it and he’s getting paid way too much money for his production. I think Wiseman could be a good fit for this team given their lack of front court offense. Actually, they have a lack of any offense so if a player can come in and put points on the board for this team then it will be an upgrade. <br>My biggest recommendation for this team is to not put a lot of money into the future. They have about 20 million in cap space this offseason and it’s vital that they don’t spend it on someone through more than a few years. The problem with this Hornets team is that they’ll overpay players that aren’t generating wins and they’ll sign them for multiple years down the road. That puts them in a hole where they can never truly contend because they can’t surround their good players with strong role players. Kemba Walker was stranded for years without any help and he left because of it. If the Hornets want to become a premier location for free agents they have to get a better reputation for team management. That starts now with this upcoming class. It’s fine if they want to sign a player to a one year contract and then see from there, but they just can’t have them signed to a Terry Rozier deal and have it inhibit them from making moves in the future. <br>Finally, it’s important for the Hornets to get draft picks. If they have space to take on bad contracts they need to utilize it. They don’t have the trade pieces to get a star nor are they a premier location for free agents so the Hornets are required to build through the draft. The best way to do this is to hit on as many picks as possible. The list of players from the New York Knicks also applies here with the exception of Nicolas Batum. If this team can draft correctly and avoid signing too many players to overpaid contracts, they can turn around the image of this franchise.<br></p>
