<h1><b>NBA Power Rankings Heading into the Restart</b></h1>
<h2>by Broderick O'Linn</h2>
<h3><b>22. Brooklyn Nets</b></h3>
<p>Let’s be honest here, the Brooklyn Nets might not have a team to put out onto the floor. Many of the players were either just signed or weren’t playing significant minutes in the rotation. The Nets recently acquired Jamal Crawford and Michael Beasley, two players that haven’t been in the NBA for over a year. There’s no way this team has any shot of making a postseason run without their three or four best players. I believe the Magic will jump them in the rankings so they are a shoe-in for a first round sweep. The only reason they still make the postseason is because Bradley Beal isn’t coming for the restart. Next year will be the year for playoff success for the Brooklyn Nets. This postseason they should get minutes and reps to some of their young guns so they have that playoff experience for when Kyrie and Durant return from injuries. I hope to see Nicolas Claxton get some good minutes in the rotation. I expect him to show some growth and be a key role player next year. Jarrett Allen could also earn his rightful spot as the starting Center. If he can develop a solid low post game then this Nets team will be deadly moving forward. I also hope to see Jamal Crawford go for 50 each game because he has absolutely nothing to lose. If I was Crawford, I would see this as a tryout for the team next year. With two of the top players in the NBA, it’s hard to imagine that the Nets wouldn’t be contenders. Crawford could be an ideal bench player that can be go to offense when KD and Kyrie are resting. His defensive liability though could hold him back unless the Nets can surround him with some solid 3 and D players. I also think Joe Harris will leave in free agency due to the Nets having little cap space. If a team offers Joe a valuable contract, I find it difficult for him to say no to it. Losing Harris might sting, but I think the Nets could find plenty of veteran 3 and D players to fill his role.</p>
<h3><b>21. Washington Wizards</b></h3>
<p>Similar to the Brooklyn Nets, this team has no shot this year. If they weren’t so far behind the Nets and Magic, I would have them making the postseason with half of the Brooklyn Nets choosing not to play. Losing Bradley Beal crushed what little hopes this team had for the playoffs. I firmly believe if they had Beal that they would have been within that four game mark of the play-in game and would’ve had a legitimate shot of beating the Nets. Maybe some of the younger guys can make a run, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up Wizard fans. Rui Hachimura will probably be handed the keys for the restart to see if he can make a jump in his rookie year. Him and Thomas Bryant will have to carry the offensive load for this team if they want a chance at sneaking in. This may be a blessing in disguise for the Wizards next year if these young players can make some major improvements. A Bradley Beal trade seems imminent so if more if these young players can learn how to lead this team then they will be better off in the long run. It is unlikely that Wall’s massive contract will be moved so i suspect he’ll be back at PG for DC. I can imagine the Wizards trading Beal to the Heat for Herro, Robinson, and some picks. With Wall and a bunch of deadly three point shooters, the Wizards could sneak in next year in a particularly weak mid-tier Eastern Conference.</p>
<h3><b>20. Sacramento Kings</b></h3>
<p>Before the NBA hiatus, this team was starting to figure things out. It’s tough to see a young team gain momentum and start to make that next step and then have all that taken away from them. De’Aaron Fox is starting to emerge as a solid PG in the West. If he improves his 3pt shot and becomes an above average facilitator, you can expect him to make some All-Star appearances in the near future. In addition to that, Buddy Hield and Richaun Holmes are playing well and can be some great pieces for the Kings. Heading into the restart, there are some major pros and cons. Buddy Hield and Jabari Parker have COVID, so their health and physical condition will be in question once the season resumes. With an already inexperienced roster, these two not being in game shape could be detrimental to their playoff hopes. The more concerning thing to me is how will this young team respond to several months off. If there was more of a veteran presence, I would have more confidence in the Kings. The only pro from all of this is their injured players have a chance to recover. The only one that won’t be with them is Marvin Bagley. With his injury history, he’s going to gather some bust labels if he can’t figure out how to stay on the court. To conclude, I don’t believe this team will jump over the Pelicans or Blazers to snag that 9th seed and be within 4 games of the Grizzlies. The silver lining is that they will gain more experience in playoff like intensity, but they are still in serious need of more veterans and a strong post player. If the Kings end up in the middle of the lottery and James Wiseman or Onyeka Okongwu falls to them, I would jump on the opportunity to put either of them into this lineup.</p>
<h3><b>19. San Antonio Spurs</b></h3>
<p>The Spurs have been on a sharp decline since Kawhi Leonard’s Uncle decided to become the Spurs’ team doctor and Kawhi’s apparent agent. This hasn’t looked like the Spurs team I know and love for a while now. The loss of Lamarcus Aldridge kills this team's hope of making that eighth playoff spot. Lyles and Poetl can possibly combine and pick up some of the slack, but there’s simply no matching Aldridge’s offensive production. His mix of post game and mid-range jumpers have been a problem for teams throughout this year. Although he hasn’t been mentioned much, Aldridge is still that player that he was in Portland. The shining hope about this team is that they have Gregg Popovich. Popovich’s Spurs have never lacked effort or hustle so I like this team more than some of the others heading into the restart. That mixed with one of the easier restart schedules could give some optimism to Spurs fans. The major problem though is that the Spurs lack the star power to make anything happen once play resumes. A younger and better Derozan struggled to lead the Raptors so I have a tough time believing he can do it with a worse Spurs roster. Lonnie Walker has patiently awaited his turn for a significant spot in the rotation and I think it’s time he’s gotten that opportunity. He’s too athletic and explosive to hold minutes from him given the circumstances. A common theme you’ve probably seen among these lower tiered teams is play the young players and see what you’ve got. My thought process is, why not? These teams fighting for the final spot are just going to run into the Lakers or Bucks and most likely get swept so why not see what your inexperienced guys can do. This restart is kinda just an experiment for the up and coming or declining teams and this Spurs team is in need of a rebuild in the not so distant future. Derozan isn’t going to become the player he was in Toronto so I suggest playing a backcourt mixture of Walker, Murray, and White and see what they can do against some of these other Western Conference teams. Then, in the offseason, move on from Derozan and Aldridge and try to receive as much trade capital as possible. Both of these players are signed through the 2021 season and then become unrestricted free agents. I can’t see them holding on to those contracts and letting them walk in free agency with no return. Neither of them are young or contain skill sets that are very sought out in today's NBA. Aldridge could be traded to a contender in order to take on a bad contract and a load of draft picks. Derozan is much more difficult to plan out. He could do the same, but I’m not sure which NBA team would really want him given his lack of a three ball. He is still a very good player, but he’s not someone I would make a move on if I’m in running for a championship. I’d look out for teams that are looking to make a splash in free agency in 2021 to trade for Demar. If they are able to unload some poor contract choices and get them off the books before summer they’d be able to sign big name players. Meanwhile, the Spurs would get their fair share of draft picks for the future and keep their young talent. 
</p>
<h3><b>18. Phoenix Suns </b></h3>
<p>Do I expect the Suns to make that final playoff spot? No. Do I think they can disrupt some teams on the way there? Absolutely. I was tempted to put the Spurs above the Suns, but I couldn’t get past the star power of Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton. Booker can go off for 30 nearly anytime he wants to and that can be a problem when those final regular season games come around. Can he carry them like Damian Lillard? No, Booker hasn’t reached that level and I’m fairly certain he won’t this season especially given a tough schedule for the restart. However, there’s no denying the offensive talent that Booker possesses. In addition, Ayton has put together a very good sophomore campaign without anybody talking about it. He’s averaging a double-double and leads the team in PER. In his six games before the end of the season, he was averaging over 20 ppg, 12 rpg, and 2 bpg. This guy is figuring out how to dominate and I believe that if you just feed the ball to Ayton there’s not too many teams that can slow him down that are fighting for that last playoff spot. If Ayton can create some perimeter space for these wing players and they can knock down threes, they can upset teams like the Spurs, Blazers, and Pelicans. However, I don’t think they are in a realistic position to catch any of the teams ahead of them. They have one of the more difficult schedules for the return and they are six games back of the Grizzlies. There are some things though I would like to see out of this team during the restart. I want Booker to evolve into a true leader and become the voice of this team and pick them up when they inevitably hit some rough stretches. Also, I want him to get guys open shots when he begins to attack early in games. Once he gets the role players going the game will become easier for him and he’ll develop into an All-NBA player. If they can also establish a solid Ayton and Booker pick and roll it can elevate this team. In order for Ayton and the team to improve, he needs to get to the line more.  He only takes about 2-3 FT’s a game. For a guy that averages somewhere between 14-16 shots a game, that is not good at all. Players like Embiid, AD, KAT, Gobert, and Harell all average 6 or more FT’s a game. Hell, Gobert doubles the amount of FT’s on half as many shots. This is where Ayton needs to improve the most on offense. He’s too good of a FT shooter and too skilled of an offensive player to only be taking 2-3 a game. If the Suns can figure out their decade long coaching and management problem, this team can become dangerous. They have to hurry though because Booker is starting to lose patience and may force his way out if moves aren’t made. </p>
<h3><b>17. Orlando Magic</b></h3>
<p>Although this team lacks the talent of some of the aforementioned teams, it has one thing I can’t say about the others: consistency. This team is the Memphis of the Eastern Conference with their similar Grit n’ Grind approach. Clifford has made the team buy into his plan and has them playing good defense every night. They also have what differentiates the playoff teams from the fringe ones: Effort. They just out work many of the teams that are more talented than them. Their offensive game plan is quite simple too. Have a solid Center in Vucevic and run the offense through him. Vucevic is a great post scorer that makes teams crowd the paint when he gets going. With the addition of some solid scorers and shooters in Aaron Gordon and Evan Fournier, they can compete against these middle tier teams. Markelle Fultz is a big question mark for this team, but he’s put together some good games for the Magic. He’s an asset moving forward and if he can regain the confidence he had in college then he can become an outstanding PG for the Magic. In order to take the next step into becoming a strong playoff team, they need to acquire talent. At their current state, they will move up into the seventh seed in the East and might be able to take a game from their first round matchup. They need to make some serious decisions in the future if they plan on becoming championship contenders. Orlando isn’t a recruiting hub like LA or Boston so signing a marquee free agent might be unrealistic. I expect them to make a move similar to Toronto and go all in on a superstar type player. They have some great trade pieces and role players to try and acquire an all-star. I’d rather make a run at a championship for one year and be stuck in the lottery for awhile than to be a first or second round exit for several years. A strange idea that I kind of like is them going after Wall AND Beal. Wall and Isaac are elite defenders and they would have three players that can be go to scorers. The only way I see this working out is if the Wizards think John Wall won’t return to form. Having all the money placed on a player that isn’t one of the best 10-20 best players could deter them from having him in their long-term plans. It would be weird working out the money and draft picks, but this could be a splash that can shake up the Eastern Conference. At worst, they need to make a move for one of the two. </p>
<h3><b>16. Portland Trail Blazers</b></h3>
<p>A year removed from their Western Conference Finals trip, the Blazers are struggling to make the playoffs. This is a team that overachieved a year before and got comfortable where they were at. You’ll see this sometimes from teams that have the same hustle and work ethic that pushes them instead of extreme talent. The Blazers lost some of their key players from last year, but they lost something far more valuable: Their Edge. This team thrived on other players, coaches, teams, and media counting them out. Every night they felt like they had something to prove and that pushed them to play harder. Honestly, the roster this year isn’t too drastically different and you can argue that it has improved. I think Carmelo is still a walking bucket and Whiteside can be a defensive anchor. The player that is keeping them afloat is Damian Lillard. You can apply my Devin Booker argument from earlier and make an even stronger case here. Lillard is one of the few players in the league that can completely take over a game. And I don’t mean just drop 30, I mean the type that determines the entire flow of the game and can single handedly get your team a W. Without Lillard, this team would drastically fall in the rankings. I can confidently say that the Blazers can beat the Kings, Spurs, and Suns in the play-in games. However, against the Pelicans and Grizzlies, Lillard will need more help unless he plans to drop 40 or more each game. McCollum has to make that leap to an All-Star caliber player during the restart in order for this team to make the playoffs. Even if they do make the playoffs, there will be some serious changes to this roster come the offseason. Damian Lillard won’t be in his prime forever and needs help NOW. He seems persistent on staying a Blazer his whole career so other players will have to go. McCollum is a solid player, but he’s just not cutting it for this team. I’ll be willing to bet almost anything that McCollum will be on a different roster next year. His value is hard to predict since he’s not quite an All-Star, but can perform well for playoff teams. Portland also isn’t in the place to rebuild so they will be trading for a more established player. Kevin Love was a popular name to throw around for the past year or two, yet he won’t elevate them to legitimate championship contenders. In order to enter that conversation, I think the Blazers should take a shot at Blake Griffin. The Pistons will look to move on without him and he’s a frontcourt player that could be a good sidekick to Lillard. Whether the Pistons or Blazers would ever think of doing this could be very low, but this is the most reasonable trade I could think of without seeming too far fetched. This trade could also keep Lillard happy for the time being which may extend his stay in Portland if he’s dissatisfied after this postseason run. </p>
<h3><b>15. New Orleans Pelicans</b></h3>
<p>I don’t really have too much to say about this team just because ESPN tries to shove all Pelicans content down our throats ever since Zion has returned. This is an obvious point, but this team will be a force to be reckoned with in the future. The talent on this roster is undeniable and how they’ve played with Zion Williamson has been nothing short of outstanding. They really don’t need to make any significant changes during the offseason once they are bounced from the restart. The mixture of Ball, Holiday, Ingram, and Zion has one of the best offensive efficiencies in the league. Throw in good wing players in JJ Reddick and Josh Hart as well as some solid bigs with Jaxson Hayes and Derrick Favors and man this team is scary going forward. The only thing missing is team chemistry and meaningful minutes in clutch situations. I’m not entirely sure what lineup works best in tight situations with the game on the line. Plus, the addition of Zion could confuse things when teams need a bucket in the last few minutes of the game. Brandom Ingram has been the closer, but has that changed since Zion has come back? I could see them force feeding Zion to try and get a bucket late in games when it usually would have just gone to Ingram. If this team can figure out what lineup works best and who is the closer in the play-in game, this team will be in the playoffs. However, they may play a Memphis team that has a team identity, a clear player hierarchy, and lineups that they know work well. Can the Pelicans figure this all out in just eight games? Only time will tell. One thing is for certain though, this will be one of the most entertaining teams in the restart. 
</p>
<h3><b>14. Memphis Grizzlies</b></h3>
<p>This is where the list of fringe playoff teams, excluding the Orlando Magic, ends. The Grizzlies hold this spot over the Pelicans for a few reasons. This team has established a coherent team identity and bust their ass every game in order to win. The Grit n’ Grind Grizzlies are back baby and I love everything about this team. In my opinion, Ja Morant is the ROTY and under his on court leadership, and coaching of Taylor Jenkins, they play hard every night and have a nice mix of young talent and veteran leadership. Also, all of their key players have played most of  the season and they know what works in the clutch and who will take the final shots. This gives them a slight edge over the Pelicans. There will be no seven game series to figure out what works against teams and what doesn’t. It’s a one or two game battle to see who gets that last playoff spot. The team that holds that eighth seed heading into the play-in games has a clear advantage and I believe that team will be the Memphis Grizzlies. They already have a few games up on all the other teams and they just need to secure three or four victories to ensure they get it. The reason why this is such an advantage is one simple thing: multiple chances. This is how the play-in works: If the 9th seed finishes within four games of the eighth seed they will have a chance to play them for the final spot. I’ll say the Pelicans finish 9th. In order to get in, they have to beat a solid Grizzlies team twice in a row. Even if the Pelicans can become the team everyone has hyped them up to be A) can they catch the Grizzlies and get the eighth spot? or B) Beat the Grizzlies twice along with holding off the other teams fighting for that final spot? I have my doubts and that’s why I have the Grizzlies ahead for now. They have been consistent all year long and I have no doubts about their talent level heading back into the restart. This is a damn good Memphis team with a lot of bright young talent. If Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson can take that next step in 2020-2021, expect to see this Grizzlies team consistently in the playoffs.</p>
<h3><b>13. Utah Jazz</b></h3>
<p>This is where my list may get controversial. On paper, this team should be higher up on the list. They have too much talent to be ranked at 13. Even without the hiatus I had concerns about this team. People remember their 19-2 run in the middle of the season and thought they took the next step. What many didn’t realize is that a good portion of those wins came against many low tiered NBA teams. Since then, they have been extremely streaky. They could get hot and win games against top teams, but then lose several games to teams that they should beat. Finally,  Gobert just had to get COVID and destroy the trust of possibly everyone in the organization. If this team can’t regain the chemistry and team unity they had before, they are heading for a first round exit, and probably an ugly one. Before, the team looked like this: a good team with an offensive stud (Donovan Mitchell), great shooting (Bogdanovic/Ingles), solid PG running the court (Conley), great depth, and a defensive anchor that is extremely versatile (Gobert). However, so much has changed for this team. To start, Bogdanovic is out. Bogdanovic is probably one of the most underrated players in the NBA and I hate that he doesn’t get the recognition he deserves. He’s your do it all forward that has zero ego and the balls to hit a double clutch fadeaway three for the win. He was such a key part to this offense and not having him will crush their playoff hopes. To further my concern, Conley has been inconsistent for them, and they have actually played their best ball with him injured. Not having that playmaker that initiates the offense definitely hurts momentum throughout the game. Outside of Conley, Mitchell is the go to ball handler and he has struggled mightley to get other players involved. To top it off, Gobert has lost the trust of his teammates from what has leaked about their locker room. Teammates have come out and said it’s water under the bridge, but I think we can all agree that there’s some bullshit surrounding those quotes. This team is limping towards the playoffs and have to address my concerns if they want to move up these rankings and make a playoff run. It wouldn’t surprise me if they decide to shake up the roster when they are booted from the playoffs. Gobert would be my go to pick, but those quotes may be right and it is actually water under the bridge. The star players on this team are young so they could decide to roll with the roster they have next year. 
</p>
<h3><b>12. Indiana Pacers</b></h3>
<p>The complete uncertainty of Victor Oladipo causes the Pacers to fall to #12. One day he’s not playing and the next it says he’s trying his best to get back on the court. I’ll assume that he’s not coming back until I physically see him in the lineup. Nevertheless, this is another team that has surprised many. The Pacers were written off with Oladipo injured to start the year, but the emergence of Sabonis combined with the great play of Brogdon and Turner has turned them into a solid playoff team. Without Oladipo, this team can give their first round matchup trouble, but I doubt they win a series, or will even see seven games. A healthy Oladipo would make this team a potential nightmare for their first round matchup and dark horse to run through the East. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to watch him play again this season. Another loss that hasn’t been talked about is Jeremy Lamb. He was someone that you could trust to come off of the bench or plug into the starting lineup to fill in for injuries. He averaged roughly 13 points and the Pacers will have to find somewhere to fill that, along with the production Oladipo provides. TJ Warren and Malcolm Brogdon will have to step up their scoring in the backcourt to pick up the slack. Brogdon is a 40-50-90 guy but he needs to be a trustworthy 2nd or 3rd option. Sabonis has been stellar all year and I know he’ll keep that streak up. Turner has been a terrific defensive player, but he has to develop a more dominant low post game for this team to have a shot in the first round. There’s not too much more to say about them. Good coaching and great work ethic, but the lack of talent will keep them from winning their first round matchup. I’ll be curious to see what they do in the offseason. Do they pull a Toronto and trade for a superstar to have one good run at the Larry O’Brien trophy or do they stick with what they know with Oladipo and try to see how far he’ll carry them? I would lean towards going all in on somebody because they have been stuck in the same position in the playoffs for several years. There’s no doubt that they can keep up this level of basketball for a while. It's just this won’t win you a championship.
</p>
<h3><b>11. Dallas Mavericks</b></h3>
<p>Let’s get the obvious out of the way. Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis are one of the best duos in the NBA. Luka has emerged as a perennial superstar while Porzingis is a great second man. Doncic is such a prolific player with how he can beat you anywhere on the offensive end. He can score at all three levels and he’s a great passer. His best ability is his proficiency with the pick n’ roll. He has great positioning coming off of screens and knows where to be to make the play. He doesn’t have the athleticism of other stars so he has to be careful on where he places defenders. This ability to force defenders where he wants them makes him the dangerous player he is. On top of that he has a great teammate to defer so if he needs someone else to handle an offensive load. Porzingis can roll or pop out of screens and be just as lethal in either position. Porzingis can also be handed the ball in the post or on the wing and you can expect him to cook whoever is guarding him if they don’t have the length or quickness needed. On top of that, the Mavericks have good depth and shooting surrounding these players. This team has the top offensive rating of 115.8 (Best in the league) and can expect to put up big numbers every night. The problem with this team, like many others, are the players that are hurt/opting not to play. The loss of Powell and Willie Cauley-Stein will sting, but not make a huge difference. The Mavericks still have enough depth and scoring in their backcourt to help make up for the shortcomings in the front court. Also, it’s a guard driven league now and I can see the Mavericks going small and having Porzingis cover the center position. Another disadvantage that might plague them is the lack of playoff experience across the board. Sure you have a couple of guys that have some minutes under their belt, but it doesn’t matter when your two best players have none. I’d say the ceiling for this team is probably the second round of the West, but I really don’t see them making it that far. The future's so bright for this team and in no time it will be Doncic and Porzingis dominating in the playoffs. Give this team a year or two and they’ll be at that championship level. They’ve got the talent, depth and coaching. All they need is to develop and they will get there.
</p>
<h3><b>10. Philadelphia 76ers</b></h3>
<p>10 teams left. 5 from the East and 5 from the West. Perfectly balanced as all things should be. The only thing not balanced is this cluster fuck of a 76ers team. This team has the talent and potential to win it all. If they can get their shit together I can see them jumping into the top 5 before playoffs begin. For right now though, they are stuck at 10. There’s no shortage of talent on this team. They have one of the top centers in the NBA with Joel Embiid, a top PG in Ben Simmons, and great players surrounding in Tobias Harris, Al Horford, and Josh Richardson. I think a big problem for the team is coaching. Brett Brown by no means is a bad coach, but I’m not sure he’s the right coach for this team. I don’t think he quite understands how to utilize all these players. He still hasn’t been able to effectively integrate Horford in and he’s really struggled because of it. He’s shifted from starter to bench and everything in between. I thought this team would take the next step this year because they now have some guys with real playoff experience. I harp on playoff experience a lot because it seriously makes the difference between winning and losing a series. Remember two years ago when the Sixers played the Celtics in the second round of the playoffs. The stats for this series were unreal. The Sixers had a lead in the final minute of four games and a 20+ point lead in another. Guess what happened in that series? The Celtics won 4-1. If you just saw the stats for the Sixers I gave, you probably would’ve thought Philly should’ve swept or won 4-1 at worst. The reason they lost is because they were a young team with no playoff experience. The next year they learned from their mistakes and still came up short from a quadruple doink. I don’t think it gets more heartbreaking than that. The ability to stay calm and collected is the most underrated and looked over ability when analyzing playoff teams/players. Last year, Jimmy brought this and allowed them to almost beat the reigning champs. I was hoping that leadership would transfer over to Horford and Embiid would become the go to down the stretch. I understand trolling and having fun, but there’s still a level of immaturity from Embiid that will hold this team back. Against the top teams in the East he is averaging 17.6 ppg and that’s unacceptable with the amount of talent he has. I hope he will evolve his game and become a truly dominant Center that we haven’t seen since Shaq. He matches up well against the Celtics, but something is still holding him back. The skillset is for sure there so he just needs to realize that there’s nobody out there that can stop him. The Sixers need to put four deadly three point shooters around him, but that won’t happen because Ben Simmons refuses to learn how to shoot. Another huge thing that I’m not quite sure is an advantage or disadvantage yet is the games will be played on a neutral court. The Sixers were a great home team, but absolutely awful on the road. Will it help that this is a neutral court? I have no idea. I don’t think we’ve seen a situation quite like this in NBA history so there’s nothing I can compare this to. This is a very confusing Sixers team. This is a make or break postseason for them. If they don’t make a deep run, things might not look so great in the city of Brotherly Love. This might be the last ride for the Simmons-Embiid tandem. 
</p>
<h3><b>9. Oklahoma City Thunder</b></h3>
<p>Another team that has exceeded expectations. To start, I’m not sure why so many people were so down on this team entering the season. It’s kinda like people forgot who Chris Paul was. His game doesn’t rely on unimaginable athleticism or quickness. Age won’t make a huge difference on how he performs unless he physically is unable to play. CP3 is the type of player to control the pace of the game and to elevate the play of the players around him. He gets his teammates to the right spots and dictates how each possession is played. He has mastered the art of managing the flow of every game. He also can run the pick n’ roll with virtually any big man in the NBA. The only player who I think clearly does all of these things better is LeBron James. In addition, he has been by far the most clutch player in the league. The Thunder have an amazing record of 25-5 in games that were within 5 points with 5 minutes remaining. This team just knows how to get it done when it comes down to it and is the best thing the young players in OKC could ask for. SGA learning from CP3 will do amazing things for his career since CP3 is one of the most pure PG’s to ever play. As long as he’s healthy, don’t count out this Thunder team. Paul’s presence will also do wonders in the playoffs due to his experience and his leadership capabilities. These attributes will help the young guns adjust and not be fazed by the difference of playoff basketball. So many good things to say about this team and I haven’t even mentioned the likely 6th man of the year Dennis Schroeder. When he, CP3, and SGA were all on the floor together, they outscored their opponents by 30 points. That’s almost unheard of. This is the perfect situation for SGA. He doesn’t have to be a playmaker with CP3 or Schroeder on the court with him. His unique skill set of getting to the hoop along with the spacing this team has fits him well. The only concern I have is the Thunder’s record against the top teams. They are 9-17 against teams above .500 entering the hiatus. This is concerning, but I’m actually not too worried about it. I expect the Thunder to finish either 4th or 5th in the West. Currently, the team they would face in the first round would be the Rockets. OKC actually matches up very well against the Rockets and I believe could beat them in a 7 game series. The other possible match ups lack the experience or are struggling. I might have the Thunder ranked lower than the Rockets, but don’t be surprised if they pull off the upset if they face off in the first round.</p>
<h3><b>8. Miami Heat</b></h3>
<p>I love this Miami Heat team. They are one piece away from being true championship contenders. They have no glaring weakness besides not having a bonafide superstar and needing maybe one more playmaker. Jimmy has proven to be a leader for this young team and Bam has emerged as a top Center in the league. Their only limitation is that Jimmy Butler will have to elevate his game if they want to take out the top teams in the East. They have great coaching and the best mix of experience and youth. They have knockdown 3PT shooting, bigs that can switch on defense, and amazing depth. It’s so much fun to watch this team play. Jimmy Butler has set the tone in Miami and the rookies have run with it. If this team can get hot from deep they could make some noise. The only problem I have going into the restart is their schedule. They have it rough when play resumes and it’s so crucial that they don’t pull Boston in the first round. If they can manage to stay in the 4th-5th range, they can win in the first round and give the Bucks some trouble. They have a winning record against Milwaukee and they match up extremely well. Come Playoffs, I have two slight concerns. First, Kendrick Nunn, Tyler Herro, and Duncan Robinson play significant minutes in their rotation as rookies or second year players so they are not accustomed to Playoff basketball. Second, Butler is one of the only true playmakers on this team that can play solid defense. Goran Dragic is a great backup, but his struggles on defense could keep him off the floor in the last few minutes of the game. I trust Spoelstra to have the rookies prepared, but I have my doubts on whether they can find another playmaker in eight games. Other than that, I really don’t have much more to say about Miami. They are a great team that will go as far as Jimmy will take them. This will probably be a legacy defining run for Butler because it all falls on his shoulders. If they can’t make a deep run, Miami should look to add another star with Butler and Bam in the offseason. </p>
<h3><b>7. Toronto Raptors</b></h3>
<p>The defending NBA champs have entered the chat. It’s been very impressive how this team has responded with the departure of Kawhi Leonard. You have to give Nick Nurse credit for what he has done for this team. So many people, myself included, thought they were going to implode and start a massive rebuild. Boy was I wrong. They currently have the third best record in the league while dealing with a plethora of injuries. Also, Siakam has stepped up and become one of the top forwards in the league and has taken the leadership role on this team. Kyle Lowry is still a great player that I believe has been severely underrated throughout his career. This team is also rounded out by great depth and role players. Serge Ibaka, Fred Vanvleet, Marc Gasol, and OG Anunoby are all valuable pieces from their recent championship and a few of these guys were injured during the year so the hiatus has allowed them to recover. This is a team you can’t take lightly because they are still a championship contender. With all that being said I do have some problems with them. They have a really tough schedule for the restart. I believe they won’t come out too hot and lose that #2 seed. In the East, those spots are very crucial. Those first round match ups are much easier than drawing the 3 or 4 seeds. In addition, strength of schedule does matter for these eight games. Usually, top teams will rest to prepare for their playoff runs, but it’s completely different due to these circumstances. Every team will be trying to regain their momentum and success they had prior to the hiatus. I don’t think the Raptors will lose in the first round, but stranger things have happened. Another concern for me is who is the go to closer in the playoffs. Although the Raptors have been clutch throughout the year, the playoffs create a different atmosphere. Kawhi was their unquestioned go to player when the game was on the line. Who will that be this year? Is it Siakam or Vanvleet? If they struggle to establish consistent scoring with time winding down, I don’t see this team getting past the second round. However, if Vanvleet can transform back to Game 6 Vanvleet that had Steph Curry begging for a switch because he caused him so many nightmares, then this team could make it out of the East. The most concerning thing of all is their performance against the top teams in the league. Against the East alone, they are 1-6. This is reminiscent of the Thunder, but the Raptors don’t have that favorable matchup like the Thunder do. To give them the benefit of the doubt, they weren’t at 100% so I don’t want to put too much emphasis on that record. Like the Sixers, this is another team that could rise very high in these rankings depending on how they answer their question marks. 
</p>
<h3><b>6. Houston Rockets</b></h3>
<p>I don’t have a whole lot to talk about with the Houston Rockets because no one really knows much about this team. It’s almost unheard of for a team to completely switch their offense halfway through the NBA season, and the crazy thing is it actually worked. Teams were confused on how to handle it and the Rockets found a lot of success with it. However, once teams got the hang of it, the Rockets struggled. They finished 1-4 before the NBA season was put on hold. That is why I believe there were very few teams that benefited from the hiatus like the Houston Rockets. It allows Mike D’Antoni to work out all the kinks of the mind boggling PJ Tucker Center experiment. This is where D’Antoni will work his magic. Teams will be unprepared for what new offensive scheme he creates and, with only eight games to scout it out, expect the Rockets to come out playing well when the season starts again. James Harden might have the best advantage from the break because the thing he struggled with the most in the playoffs is his conditioning. The load he carries usually has him exhausted by the time playoffs roll around and has been his biggest weakness his whole career with Houston. However, he currently looks like he’s in the best shape of his life. Add in a healthy Westbrook with solid pieces in Gordon and Covington and you’ve got a strange, but frightening team. This star power alone has them really high on this list, but the huge concern for Houston is match ups. If they draw OKC in the first round they may be in trouble. It would also be preferable if they could avoid the Lakers in the second. Their new small ball lineup can be dangerous, but can bite them in the ass pretty quickly. I’m not one for tanking for a better match up, but I would consider it if I was Houston. This may be bold, but I would prefer them to play a combo of Nuggets-Clippers than Thunder-Lakers. Although, I would love to see a Thunder-Rockets series where Westbrook and Paul go at their former teams. 
</p>
<h3><b>5. Denver Nuggets</b></h3>
<p>Just based on talent alone, the Nuggets shouldn’t be in the top 5. The reason I have them here is because of the type of game they play. They are ranked 29th in the NBA in pace and this gives them a big advantage once play resumes. We have no idea what shape these players will be in and the teams that don’t run as much or don’t rely on face break scoring will adjust more effectively than the ones that run high pace and up-tempo offenses. The Nuggets like distributing the ball and getting into their offensive sets instead of attacking the floor as quick as they get a rebound. The Nuggets are also a deep team which should help their odds as well. These deep teams can go into their rotation and throw a diverse lineup of players out if they aren’t in game shape. Jokic also looks like he’s been hitting the weights and slimming down. If he can retain his strength and add a quick first step to his arsenal then he will be even more lethal than he already is. His biggest critique was that he was tired at the end of games and didn’t play great when it came down to the wire. He’s improved his clutch shooting, but this slim Jokic could be a whole different story. Furthermore, a Murray-Jokic pick’n’roll is one of the best in the NBA. Both players can shoot from anywhere on the floor or distribute the ball without a problem. Another player I would lookout for on this team is Gary Harris. Before the hiatus, he was shooting the ball amazing from deep. If he can pick up where he left off this Nuggets team could be a problem come playoff time. Like the Miami Heat, the big question mark here is lack of star power. Can Murray elevate his game and become Jokic’s sidekick? I’m leaning towards no, but would love if he proved me wrong. If he’s unable to, then look for this team to make a huge trade in the offseason. Murray and Harris need to improve in order for this team to win a championship. They have to prove that quick or teams like the Mavericks, Pelicans, and Grizzlies will overtake them in a few years. Bradley Beal or Victor Oladipo are good trade options if the Nuggets choose to move on from Murray and/or Harris. Michael Porter Jr. would also be a player to look out for due to his breakout potential and trade value.</p>
<h3><b>4. Los Angeles Clippers</b></h3>
<p>This is where I might take the most heat. Yes, the Clippers, on paper, are the best team in the NBA. There’s no denying the amount of great players that are on this roster, but this team still lacks a definitive team identity. Some people just believe that if you put a bunch of great players together that they will win not matter what. That was the problem with the Clippers in the past and will be the downfall of the Clippers this year. There is such a thing of too many mouths to feed. Also, this team has barely played together as a complete unit this season. Leonard has load management, George has been hurt, and they just acquired Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris. This hiatus has hurt the Clippers the worst, by far. This team needs more reps together to know what line ups work best, which players play together best, and who will be in the closing line up. I don’t think eight games will be enough. All the teams ahead of them have a concrete team identity. They know how to play together and who will be closing. This Clippers team needs to get better chemistry, 3 PT shooting, and defensive rotations down the stretch. It is more than likely that they will play the Lakers in the playoffs and they need to be ready by then. Talent will carry them there but they need to be more cohesive as a team to beat the Lakers. The last time the Clips and Lakers played, LeBron and AD had it their way the entire game. I’m extremely concerned that no one on the Clippers can cover AD. AD might be the most versatile player in the NBA and the Clippers have really struggled containing him. If they can’t keep one of LeBron or AD in check then I’m afraid the Clippers won’t beat them. Furthermore, Lou Will was a defensive liability when closing games. That won’t be a problem until later in the playoffs, but we saw how he was tortured by the Lakers in their last matchup. Finally, Paul George is an attack first player that has been indecisive ever since joining the Clippers. He looks uncomfortable in the offense because he’s now the second option. I think he has deferred when he should be attacking the rim and that type of play can’t happen against the Lakers. If he can become that scorer he was with the Pacers and Thunder then that will elevate this offense to almost unbeatable heights. Until then, Doc Rivers has a lot of shit to figure out.
</p>
<h3><b>3. Boston Celtics</b></h3>
<p>This Celtics team has a real shot of making it out of the East. They are top 5 in offensive and defensive efficiency. On average, they hold the top ten offensive teams to 106 ppg. That is just simply amazing. Brad Stevens is one of the best coaches in the NBA and has proved over the past several years. They have four guys who can average 20+ ppg (Tatum, Brown, Kemba, Hayward) and any of those four and can get a bucket when the game, or series, is on the line. This break has allowed both Kemba and Hayward to recover completely from their injuries as well. This team has a nice mix of depth and playoff experience that will make them a nightmare later on. Marcus Smart is possibly the scrappiest NBA player and can defend nearly all 5 positions. Tatum has emerged as this teams closer and has done great in those situations. More importantly, he’s done it against the best teams on the biggest stages. He and Kemba will have great playoff performances and lead this team to at least the ECF. I believe that they will take the 2 seed from the Raptors because of how easy their schedule is for the restart. My only concern for this team is if they match up against a dominant Center. Kanter and Theis are a solid pairing for them right now, but I’d be concerned if the Celtics matched up against someone like Joel Embiid. Kanter is a great scorer, but can't guard anybody. Theis is kind of the opposite and won’t be able to contain Embiid the whole game, if any of it at all. If the Miami Heat and Philadelphia 76ers get the 4 and 5 seeds and can avoid playing either, I think the Celtics will definitely make it to the ECF. If they end up falling short this year, I don’t expect them to make many moves given how young this team is and how Danny Ainge loves to hold onto his picks and players. 
</p>
<h3><b>2. Los Angeles Lakers</b></h3>
<p>It might seem strange that my title favorites don’t come in at #1 on my list. If this list was done a few weeks after the hiatus started the Lakers would 100% be first. They had all the momentum in the world after beating the Bucks and Clips during the same weekend. LeBron and AD are the best duo in the NBA and could become one of the best ever. I don’t have to go on too long about this team because everyone knows who they are. Once the playoffs start I can dive into this offense and what makes them special, but for now we’ll just get into what they need to improve or what bothers me. To start, I have a few concerns with them though. First, they are an older team. How are they going to respond to this hiatus? Will they be rusty or have they been keeping in shape the past several months. The reason why this is more concerning for the Lakers as opposed to other teams is because they lead the league in fast break points. They like to get out and run with teams because a fourth of all of their points come in transition. That’s a lot compared to the other teams and is a cause for concern if their players aren’t in shape. Since this is an old team, I would like to think they’re going to be prepared. The next issue is how JR and Dion will fit in the rotation. I will accept no JR slander on here because he was a huge reason the Cavs beat the Warriors in 2016, but the HENNY GOD hasn’t played all year. I’m not sure what to expect from either of them, but I know neither are scared of big moments. Finally, it seems that they addressed their 3 point shooting problem. JR and Dion can light it up from deep once they get adjusted to the rotation and Caruso and KCP aren’t the worst players to turn to. 3 point shooting is crucial to beating the Bucks and the Lakers will win once the threes are falling. If the Lakers can recapture the momentum they had in March then I will easily put them at #1.
</p>
<h3><b>1. Milwaukee Bucks</b></h3>
<p>It’s very difficult to bet against the Bucks. They have been dominant throughout the year and Giannis will more than likely take home the MVP. I’m also not worried about the break messing with this team. They are deep and have a great coach in Budenholzer. In addition, the Bucks can match up with any team offensively or defensively. Their offensive plan is actually really simple; spread the floor and let Giannis do his thing in the paint. They shoot great from deep at every position. Lopez isn’t a great post-up player, but he can get it done down there as well as spread the floor. Giannis is virtually unstoppable when he gets in transition and they have athletes and shooters across the board. This team has very few, if any weaknesses. Where they are weak though it is apparent. The Bucks losses have all come when their opponent has out shot them from 3. The Bucks dare you to shoot the 3 on them while they hunker the paint. That’s why I like teams like the Celtics and Heat against the Bucks. Those teams can hit threes and once that floor opens up the offense will get easier to run. This will then lead to the next problem, clutch shooting for the Bucks. They haven’t really been tested too often this year, but when they have they’ve struggled. This has a lot to do with Giannis not being able to score on all three levels yet. If a team loads up the paint or if someone can manage to keep Giannis in check, how will this team score in the clutch? Giannis can’t step out for 3 with the game on the line or really take mid-range jumpers. His post game is alright but nothing to depend on come the ECF or Finals. So this pressure is then put on Khris Middleton. I think he’s a fantastic player and can shoot the lights out, but how will he perform on the biggest stage with the game on the line? I don’t trust him more than the closers on say the Celtics or Lakers. The Bucks may currently be #1, but I don’t think they’ll finish here.
